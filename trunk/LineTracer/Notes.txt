- circle detect (in skeletonizer)
- new line prune layer
- rewrite polyline structure? global point collection?
- stoppa tracing mot gradientens riktning


==================================

The significance of a straight line fit to a list of points can be estimated by
calculating the ratio of the length of the line segment divided by the maximum
deviation of any point from the line (the maximum deviation is always assumed to
be at least two pixels in size to account for limitations on measurement accuracy).
This measure will remain constant as the scale of the image is changed, and it
therefore provides a scale­independent measure of significance that places no prior
expectations on the allowable deviations. This significance measure is then used
in a modified version of the recursive endpoint subdivision method (see Figure
7). A segment is recursively subdivided at the point with maximum deviation
from a line connecting its endpoints (Figure 7 (b,c)). This process is repeated
until each segment is no more than 4 pixels in length, producing a binary tree of
possible subdivisions. This representation is similar to the strip trees described
